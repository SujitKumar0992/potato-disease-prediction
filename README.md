# potato-disease-prediction

## Problem Statement
To develop a model or system that can accurately predict the occurrence of diseases in potato crops. This would involve identifying the different types of diseases that can affect potato crops, such as blight, scab, blackleg, and viral infections, and developing a method to detect and predict their occurrence.

The goal of this problem statement is to help potato farmers and growers take preventative measures to minimize the impact of disease on their crops. By accurately predicting when and where disease outbreaks are likely to occur, farmers can take steps to prevent the spread of disease and protect their potato crops.


## Solutions :
Our dataset consist of 3 types of potato disease
1. Late blight: This is a fungal disease that affects the leaves, stems, and tubers of potato plants. It is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans and can cause significant damage to potato crops.

2. Early blight: This is a fungal disease that affects the leaves of potato plants, causing brown spots and discoloration. It is caused by the pathogen Alternaria solani.
3. Healthy

we build a CNN architecture that can predict the disease of potato


## Tech Stack Used
1. Python 
2. FastAPI 
3. Deep learning algorithms(CNN)
